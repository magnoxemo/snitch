Snitch is a mesh tally clustering program built on top of libMesh. Currently I am using and developing this as a test bed framework for my research

to run the code build the testcase and the command line argument will as:

`nx, ny, lower_left_x,upper_left_x, lower_left_y,upper_left_y)`

Where: 
nx           = number of elements in x direction
ny           = number of elements in x direction
lower_left_x = left most co-ordinate in x axis
upper_left_x = upper most co-ordinate in x axis
lower_left_y = left most co-ordinate in x axis
upper_left_y = upper most co-ordinate in x axis
